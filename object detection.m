%% Classify Webcam Images Using Deep Learning
% This example shows how to classify images from a webcam in real time
% using the pretrained deep convolutional neural network GoogLeNet.
%
% Use MATLAB(R), a simple webcam, and a deep neural network to identify
% objects in your surroundings. This example uses GoogLeNet, a pretrained
% deep convolutional neural network (CNN or ConvNet) that has been trained
% on over a million images and can classify images into 1000 object
% categories (such as keyboard, coffee mug, pencil, and many animals). You
% can download GoogLeNet and use MATLAB to continuously process the camera
% images in real time.
%
% GoogLeNet has learned rich feature representations for a wide range of
% images. It takes the image as input and provides a label for the object
% in the image and the probabilities for each of the object categories. You
% can experiment with objects in your surroundings to see how accurately
% GoogLeNet classifies images. To learn more about the network's object
% classification, you can show the scores for the top five classes in real
% time, instead of just the final class decision.

%% Load Camera and Pretrained Network
% Connect to the camera and load a pretrained GoogLeNet network. You can
% use any pretrained network at this step. The example requires MATLAB
% Support Package for USB Webcams, and Deep Learning Toolbox(TM) Model _for
% GoogLeNet Network_. If you do not have the required support packages
% installed, then the software provides a download link.
camera = webcam;
net = googlenet;

%%%
% If you want to run the example again, first run the command |clear
% camera| where |camera| is the connection to the webcam. Otherwise, you
% see an error because you cannot create another connection to the same
% webcam.

%% Classify Snapshot from Camera
% To classify an image, you must resize it to the input size of the
% network. Get the first two elements of the |InputSize| property of the
% image input layer of the network. The image input layer is the first
% layer of the network.
inputSize = net.Layers(1).InputSize(1:2)

%%
% Display the image from the camera with the predicted label and its
% probability. You must resize the image to the input size of the network
% before calling |classify|.
figure
im = snapshot(camera);
image(im)
im = imresize(im,inputSize);
[label,score] = classify(net,im);
title({char(label),num2str(max(score),2)});

%% Continuously Classify Images from Camera
% To classify images from the camera continuously, include the previous
% steps inside a loop. Run the loop while the figure is open. To stop the
% live prediction, simply close the figure. Use |drawnow| at the end of
% each iteration to update the figure.
h = figure;

while ishandle(h)
    im = snapshot(camera);
    image(im)
    im = imresize(im,inputSize);
    [label,score] = classify(net,im);
    title({char(label), num2str(max(score),2)});
    drawnow
end

%% Display Top Predictions
% The predicted classes can change rapidly. Therefore, it can be helpful to
% display the top predictions together. You can display the top five
% predictions and their probabilities by plotting the classes with the
% highest prediction scores.

%%%
% Classify a snapshot from the camera. Display the image from the camera
% with the predicted label and its probability. Display a histogram of the
% probabilities of the top five predictions by using the |score| output of
% the |classify| function.

%%%
% Create the figure window. First, resize the window to have twice the
% width, and create two subplots.
h = figure;
h.Position(3) = 2*h.Position(3);
ax1 = subplot(1,2,1);
ax2 = subplot(1,2,2);

%%%
% In the left subplot, display the image and classification together.
im = snapshot(camera);
image(ax1,im)
im = imresize(im,inputSize);
[label,score] = classify(net,im);
title(ax1,{char(label),num2str(max(score),2)});

%%%
% Select the top five predictions by selecting the classes with the highest
% scores.
[~,idx] = sort(score,'descend');
idx = idx(5:-1:1);
classes = net.Layers(end).Classes;
classNamesTop = string(classes(idx));
scoreTop = score(idx);

%%%
% Display the top five predictions as a histogram.
barh(ax2,scoreTop)
xlim(ax2,[0 1])
title(ax2,'Top 5')
xlabel(ax2,'Probability')
yticklabels(ax2,classNamesTop)
ax2.YAxisLocation = 'right';

%% Continuously Classify Images and Display Top Predictions
% To classify images from the camera continuously and display the top
% predictions, include the previous steps inside a loop. Run the loop while
% the figure is open. To stop the live prediction, simply close the figure.
% Use |drawnow| at the end of each iteration to update the figure.

% |ActivePositionProperty| to |'position'|.
